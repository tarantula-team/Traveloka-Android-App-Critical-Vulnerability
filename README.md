# Traveloka Android App Critical Vulnerability
Exported Webview in Traveloka Android app lead to opening arbitrary URLs/XSS (by any third-party apps) or read any protected files (with a physical access)

**Researcher: Tony of The Tarantula Team, VinCSS (a member of Vingroup)**

## Background

We found an exported Webview Activity (**com.traveloka.android.activity.common.WebViewActivity**) in Traveloka Android app but it didn't have any protection mechanism. It means that it can be accessed by any third-party apps installed on the same device (No need to be a rooted device). On the newest Androids it also could be exploited by Android Instant Apps directly from a Web Browser.

In **com.traveloka.android.activity.common.WebViewActivity**, We can see that this Webview will get the URL from the Intent data and load it:

And because this Webview and most of Traveloka's Webview enabled Javascript Interface. So we can opening arbitrary URLs/XSS with **com.traveloka.android.activity.common.WebViewActivity**

We also can read any protected files from /data/data/com.traveloka.android/* directory (By default on Android, you cannot access and read the content of the files stored in /data/data/ directory if your device is not rooted.):

Traveloka has stored a lot of sensitive customer information (including account information, fingerprint tokens, OTP tokens and more) in the Shared_Prefs folder, so we can get a lot of sensitive information through this vulnerability:

So, with this Vulnerability, attacker can:

- Makes the Traveloka app never run (by passing Extra data or malformed data into vulnerability Activity).
- Execute Javascript code to display deceptive, fake or politically sensitive content on Traveloka App's Activity, or display phishing content to trick Traveloka users into providing sensitive information. There is no way to use Javascript to get sensitive information directly.
- Attackers who have physical access to a user's device can read sensitive files via this vulnerability. Yes, attackers need physical access. Because there is no way for a third-party application to read the content of sensitive files directly in this case.

## Steps to Reproduce

Install Traveloka Android app V3.14.0 or earlier (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.traveloka.android) and login with any customer account

If you want to reproduce this vulnerability with adb: 

```
adb shell am start -n com.traveloka.android/com.traveloka.android.activity.common.WebViewActivity -d "file:///data/data/com.traveloka.android/shared_prefs/com.traveloka.android.pref_user.xml"
```

```
adb shell am start -n com.traveloka.android/com.traveloka.android.activity.common.WebViewActivity -d "javascript:alert\(1\)"
```

If you want to reproduce this vulnerability with third-party app:

```java
Intent intent = new Intent();
intent.setClassName("com.traveloka.android", "com.traveloka.android.activity.common.WebViewActivity");
intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
intent.setData(Uri.parse("file:///data/data/com.traveloka.android/shared_prefs/com.traveloka.android.pref_user.xml"));
startActivity(intent);
```
